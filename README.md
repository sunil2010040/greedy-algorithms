# greedy-algorithms

Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. 
So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are the best fit for Greedy.


For a problem to be solved using the Greedy approach, it must follow a few major characteristices:

There is an ordered list of resources(profit, cost, value, etc.) 
Maximum of all the resources(max profit, max value, etc.) are taken. 
For example, in the fractional knapsack problem, the maximum value/weight is taken first according to available capacity.
